## Project 3: Web APIs & Classification

## Problem Statement

Can a model be built to predict from which subreddit a post is taken using only its title?

## Executive Summary

Post titles from two similar subreddits, the Alabama rolltide and Auburn sports forums, are webscrapped and analyzed. Models are then built to predict from which of these subreddits a post title is taken.

Several models including a decision tree classifier, support vector classifier, and logistic regression model are trained using the data obtained. Each performs well at the appointed task.

Though the two subreddits used in this project were similar, the differences in post titles were enough to allow for a successful model. It is concluded that classification models can be very useful in predicting from which subreddit a post is taken.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Though the two subreddits used in this project were similar, the differences in post titles were enough to allow for a successful model. Though arguably the simplest of those built, the logistic regression model performed the best.
Evidently, classification models can be very useful in predicting from which subreddit a post is taken.
